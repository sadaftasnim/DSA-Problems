This file demonstrates how to use the `Trie` data structure by performing basic operations like **insertion**, **searching**, and **deletion** of words. The Trie is tested with a set of operations to show how the data structure works in practice.

---

## File Description

### **Trie_use.cpp**
This file contains the `main` function where the Trie operations are tested. It includes the following actions:

1. **Inserting Words**: Adds words such as "abc", "are", and "dog" into the Trie.
2. **Searching Words**: Checks if a specific word exists in the Trie.
3. **Removing Words**: Deletes a word from the Trie and verifies that it is removed.

### Key Operations Demonstrated:
- **Insertion**: Adds words to the Trie using `t.insertWord("word")`.
- **Search**: Checks for the presence of a word with `t.searchWord("word")`. Outputs `1` (true) if the word is found, `0` (false) otherwise.
- **Removal**: Removes a word from the Trie with `t.removeWord("word")`.
